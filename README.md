# CCWWatchface

Counter clock wise (CCW) watches move the hands in the opposite direction.
They are also known as counterclockwise, anticlockwise, reverse and backwards watches.
Why? Because I like logic and because that definition of clockwise motion is "is one that proceeds in the same direction as a clock's hands" (Wikipedia).
That implies that a counterclockwise watch is a logical contradiction on itself.
